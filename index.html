                        <p>At my first hackathon at Northeastern, I worked on a Legal Document Analyzer, a tool to extract key details from legal texts using natural language processing. I used SpaCy for named entity recognition to pull out things like dates, names, and clauses, and integrated a BERT model to classify documents—like contracts or wills—with 92% accuracy. I built the backend with FastAPI to process the data quickly and created a React frontend to show the results in a clean, easy-to-read table. My team took 2nd place, which was a proud moment and showed I could deliver solid solutions under tight deadlines. My second project was the AI Stylist app, an AI-powered outfit recommendation system. I set up a client-server setup with a React.js frontend using Vite for a fast, smooth UI, and a FastAPI backend to handle the heavy lifting. Using OpenAI’s CLIP model, I made the system analyze clothing details—like type, color, and material—from user-uploaded images. I added real-time weather data through APIs to make weather-appropriate suggestions and let users pick their style preferences, like casual or formal, so the AI could recommend outfits that fit their vibe. The system’s design is modular, supporting different AI models like Hugging Face and Ollama, which makes it easy to scale up in the future.</p>

                        <p>In March 2025, I was a group leader for Experiential Spring Break at Northeastern University, a week-long program that mixed tech learning with professional growth. On the first day, I visited OneSixOne Ventures to learn about venture capital, getting a sense of investment strategies and what it takes to break into that field. The next day, I took a private course at AWS Skills Center on Demystifying Generative AI, where I explored the differences between AI and ML and how they’re used in the real world. On day three, I toured T-Mobile’s HQ, joining a panel discussion and networking session that showed me how data drives telecom innovation. The fourth day was a visit to Microsoft’s campus, hosted by an NU-Seattle alumna, where I learned about their AI work and got to check out the Xbox room. The week wrapped up with a Prompt Engineering session, which helped me get better at crafting AI interactions. I also made some great connections while exploring Seattle spots like the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and Bellevue Downtown Park, blending tech insights with fun cultural experiences.</p>

                        <p>In December 2022, I joined Cognizant full-time as an AWS Data Engineer, working on a historical data migration project for Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which was a huge learning experience. My role involved building and managing data pipelines to migrate over 50 terabytes of sensitive health and personal data, using AWS Glue for ETL processes to extract, transform, and load the data efficiently. I stored the data securely in Amazon S3, set up Amazon Redshift for data warehousing to support analytics, and used AWS Lake Formation to manage data access and governance across the project. Since the data was highly sensitive, I implemented encryption with AWS KMS and set up fine-grained access controls using IAM roles to meet strict healthcare compliance standards. Our team followed agile practices, using Jira to track tasks and holding sprint planning sessions every two weeks to prioritize deliverables and address blockers. I also leveraged AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows, ensuring the pipelines ran smoothly, and used Amazon CloudWatch to monitor job performance, setting up alarms for any failures. By optimizing the Glue jobs with parallel processing and refining Redshift schemas, I helped reduce migration time by 15%. Working with a seasoned team, I deepened my understanding of big data technologies, cloud architecture, and secure data management, learning how to handle large-scale projects with precision and care.</p>

                        <p>I started my internship at Cognizant in February 2022 while finishing up my final year at Osmania University, and it was my first real taste of working in tech. I joined a team migrating an on-premises inventory management app to Azure, where I worked with Azure App Services to deploy the application and Azure Blob Storage to handle product images and transaction logs. One of my tasks was building a monitoring tool with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, setting up alerts for when CPU or memory usage got too high so we could keep the system stable. On weekends, we had assessments where I created a cost optimization dashboard using Azure Cost Management APIs, which helped the team spot underused resources and cut costs by 10%. I was thrilled to be named one of the Top 10 GenZ Interns, which gave me the chance to present my work to senior leaders. The internship really sharpened my skills in cloud computing, Azure tools, and solving problems under pressure.</p>

                        <p>I graduated with a Bachelors in Information Technology from Osmania University in Hyderabad back in June 2022, and it was such a formative experience for me. My courses—like Algorithms, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Distributed Systems, Computer Networks, and Database Systems—gave me a solid grounding in the tech world. I got hands-on with programming in C, C++, Java, and Python, which I used in projects like building a campus navigation system with Dijkstra’s algorithm in C++ to find the shortest paths between buildings. I also created a library management system with a relational database in SQL, figuring out how to structure tables and queries to keep everything running smoothly. Working on a group project where we built a file-sharing app using socket programming in Java taught me how to collaborate effectively, divvy up tasks, and explain technical ideas to my teammates and professors, which really boosted my teamwork and communication skills.</p>

                        <p>During my time at Osmania University, I worked on an Age and Gender Analysis project using Machine Learning, which really got me excited about data science. I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Python and TensorFlow to predict someone’s age and gender from facial images, training it on the UTKFace dataset with 20,000 images. I had to preprocess the data carefully—resizing images, normalizing them, and using data augmentation to handle things like poor lighting or uneven age groups in the dataset. After tweaking the model’s learning rate and batch size, I got it to an accuracy of 87%, which felt like a big win. I presented the project at our university’s tech fest, and the faculty appreciated how it could be used for demographic analysis in real-world scenarios. This project helped me get better at building ML models, cleaning up data, and talking about my work in a clear, technical way.</p>

                        <p>In December 2020, I co-founded WoofAid with a few friends to help stray dogs and cats in Hyderabad during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many people wrongly believed these animals were spreading the virus. We organized food drives and set up temporary shelters, managing to care for over 200 animals in our first year. I took the lead on coordinating a team of 10 volunteers, handling logistics, managing donations, and spreading the word through social media campaigns that reached over 5,000 people. After 18 months, we got the local government on board, and six months later, we handed over the operations to them so I could focus on starting my career. Our work got some attention at Osmania University, and I was invited for a radio interview by a student club, which was a great chance to share our story. Leading WoofAid taught me how to manage projects, work with a team, and speak confidently about something I cared about. [Placeholder for pictures and video]</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Summary</h2>
        <p>I’m a Software Engineer and a graduate student in Information Systems at Northeastern University, Seattle. My work spans data engineering, AI/ML, backend development, and cloud infrastructure. I focus on building complete systems that solve clearly defined problems, from data extraction to API delivery and user interaction.

            At Cognizant, I worked as an AWS Data Engineer. I built automated ETL pipelines using Python and SQL to extract data from production sources, transform them based on business logic, and load them into Redshift for internal dashboards. I also created PySpark scripts to parse semi-structured JSON logs and reformat them for analysis in Athena. One of my main projects involved migrating over 1TB of historical data to Snowflake, rewriting queries to take advantage of Snowflake’s architecture, which helped lower storage costs and improve performance. I worked with the DevOps team to integrate these pipelines into CI/CD workflows and built parameterized job templates so that new data feeds could be onboarded with minimal changes.
            
            At Northeastern, I’m currently working on a research project that studies how age impacts cancer progression. I handle large clinical datasets, clean and structure them using Python, and optimize queries to analyze trends with statistical models. I also support a separate NLP research stream where I experiment with prompt tuning and fine-tuning transformer models to generate counter-narratives.
            
            Outside academics, I work on AI-driven projects. One of them is an AI Stylist that recommends outfits based on weather and user preferences. I used DeepLabV3-ResNet50 to segment clothing items in user-uploaded photos, processed the results using FastAPI, pulled live weather data from OpenWeatherMap, and filtered outfit suggestions accordingly. I stored all assets on AWS S3 and used React on the frontend to let users drag, drop, and mix outfits. Another project I built was a legal document analyzer, which parses PDFs, classifies sections using an NLP-based pipeline, and shows results in a searchable interface.
            
            I’ve also taken up leadership roles where I could connect with people and share what I know. During Northeastern’s Experiential Spring Break, I was a student group leader and helped organize AI-focused discussions with professionals from AWS, Microsoft, and T-Mobile. Through Cognizant Outreach, I mentored more than 175 students by reviewing resumes, explaining what different tech roles actually involve, and helping them get hands-on with projects and interview prep.

        <h3>Masters in Information Systems (Sep 2024 - May 2026)</h3>
        <p>At Northeastern, my coursework has focused on software engineering, algorithms, data structures, cloud infrastructure, and applied machine learning. I’ve taken subjects like Application Engineering and Development, Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, Data Science Engineering, and Web Design and User Experience, which helped me build practical systems using technologies such as Python, FastAPI, React, and AWS.

            I didn’t just complete assignments, I extended them into real-world projects. I participated in a hackathon where I built a full-stack application with a Python-FastAPI backend, hosted on AWS, and connected it to a React frontend with responsive UI design. In another, I implemented a data processing pipeline that extracted insights from multi-source datasets and visualized trends using statistical modeling. These projects taught me how to integrate cloud services, design RESTful APIs, manage data flows, and debug distributed system behavior under different loads.
            
            Alongside coursework and hackathons, I’ve taken part in collaborative research. I’ve applied machine learning models in both academic and personal projects, like working on "Counter Narrative Generation" for structured and unstructured datasets. My time at Northeastern has been about applying what I learn immediately in contexts that mirror industry workflows, from deploying applications to working with production-scale data and cloud-based systems.
            
            </p>
        <h3>Bachelors in Information Technology (2018-2022)</h3>
        <p>During my undergraduate studies, I focused on understanding the foundational principles of computer systems and programming. I took coursework in algorithms, operating systems, databases, computer networks, and object-oriented programming. These subjects helped me build a strong technical base, especially in problem-solving using data structures and low-level system logic.

            As I progressed, I began applying these concepts to small projects. I developed automation tools using Python and shell scripting, built websites using JavaScript and HTML, and worked on SQL-based systems for local data management. One of the turning points was my final-year project, where I created a plagiarism detection system that analyzed documents using cosine similarity and token matching — a practical way to explore natural language processing without using pre-built AI libraries. This project helped me understand how theoretical knowledge in algorithms and text processing could be applied to a real-world use case with measurable output.
            
            Beyond academics, I also contributed to college tech fests, mentored juniors in debugging sessions, and took part in coding challenges. These experiences gave me early exposure to collaborative development and real-time problem-solving — skills that later became essential in my internships and graduate work.

        <h3>Hackathon Projects</h3>
        <h3> Microsoft Hackathon – Legal Document Analyzer </h3>
        <p>At the Microsoft Redmond Hackathon, I worked on a legal document analysis tool designed to parse long contracts and highlight relevant clauses based on user queries. Our goal was to reduce the time it takes to manually sift through legal agreements by automating clause extraction and section summarization.
            
            I was responsible for designing the backend logic, where I built a pipeline that accepted multi-page PDFs, parsed the text using pdfminer.six, and organized content by detecting section headers, clause numbering patterns, and indentation heuristics. I implemented a custom rule-based segmentation algorithm that identified legal sections like “Termination,” “Governing Law,” or “Indemnification” based on regex patterns and phrase similarity. After segmentation, I used a lightweight NLP model (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) to match user queries against clause content, so users could retrieve the most relevant sections with contextual snippets.
            
            To make the system interactive, I exposed these components through a FastAPI backend and connected it to a basic frontend where users could upload documents, type queries, and get real-time responses. The end-to-end system reduced the time needed to locate legal content by over 70% in demo use cases. I also implemented basic caching to avoid redundant parsing and used Spacy for named entity recognition (e.g., contract dates, parties) to enhance contextual understanding. This project gave me hands-on experience combining document parsing, NLP, and full-stack deployment under tight time constraints.
            
            </p>
        <h3>Qualcomm x Northeastern Hackathon – AI Stylist </h3>
        <p> During the Qualcomm x Northeastern Hackathon, I developed an AI-powered wardrobe assistant that recommends weather-appropriate outfits by analyzing clothing images and environmental context. The goal was to combine computer vision and user interaction to deliver personalized style suggestions in real-time.

            My contribution focused on the ML backend. I used Qualcomm’s implementation of the DeepLabV3-ResNet50 model to segment clothing items from user-uploaded photos. I processed the model’s segmentation masks to isolate clothing regions, then mapped them to clothing categories (e.g., tops, pants) using post-processing heuristics based on bounding box area, aspect ratio, and color clustering.
            
            Once segmented, I linked each identified clothing item to a metadata tag (e.g., fabric weight, sleeve length) that could be filtered using weather conditions. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time temperature and weather data for the user's location. Based on these values, I applied filtering logic (e.g., exclude heavy jackets in warm weather, prioritize breathable fabrics when humid) to generate relevant outfit combinations. All of this logic ran on a FastAPI backend, and I stored processed user images and clothing masks on AWS S3. On the frontend, I built an interactive React interface that allowed users to drag and rearrange clothing items and save preferred combinations.
            
            The system demonstrated a full ML-integrated workflow — from image segmentation and filtering logic to cloud storage and user interaction — and it laid the foundation for building deeper personalization using recommendation algorithms.
            
            </p>

        <h3>Age and Gender Analysis Using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>For a hackathon that happened during my undergraduation , I developed a machine learning system that predicts a person’s age range and gender based on facial images. The project was motivated by use cases in crowd analytics, demographic estimation, and user profiling for offline businesses.

            The first step involved constructing a labeled dataset using publicly available facial image repositories, such as UTKFace and Adience. I preprocessed these images using OpenCV to normalize brightness, scale face dimensions, and align facial landmarks. I then extracted facial embeddings using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (VGG16) and fine-tuned a smaller CNN model on our dataset to predict both age (in bins) and gender as separate outputs in a multi-task learning setup.
            
            For training, I used cross-entropy loss for gender classification and mean absolute error for age regression, applying dropout and batch normalization to avoid overfitting. I experimented with several optimizer configurations (Adam, SGD with momentum) and adjusted learning rates using ReduceLROnPlateau to improve convergence. On evaluation, the model achieved around 89% gender classification accuracy and an average error of 4.2 years on age estimation. I packaged the model using Flask and built a simple web interface that allowed users to upload an image and view predicted age/gender in real-time.
            
            This project deepened my understanding of computer vision pipelines, CNN architectures, and the importance of preprocessing and augmentation in real-world deployment of ML models.

        <h3>Cognizant - Blue Cross Blue Shield Association
            Full-Time - AWS Data Engineer (Dec 2022 - Dec 2023)</h3>
        <p>In December 2022, I joined Cognizant full-time as an AWS Data Engineer with a focus on building, automating, and optimizing cloud-based data pipelines for enterprise-scale reporting and analytics. I was part of a cross-functional team that handled ingestion, transformation, and delivery of high-volume datasets across financial, operational, and compliance domains.

            My primary responsibility was designing ETL workflows that extracted data from multiple sources, including S3, RDS, and third-party APIs, and loaded it into Redshift and Snowflake for downstream analytics teams. I wrote modular Python scripts to perform data parsing, validation, and transformation, incorporating error logging and data quality checks at each stage. For handling large volumes of semi-structured data (e.g., JSON logs and flattened XML files), I used AWS Glue and PySpark, where I designed custom Spark jobs to flatten nested fields, deduplicate records, and enforce schema consistency before pushing data to queryable stores.
            
            To optimize performance and reduce costs, I migrated over 1TB of historical data from Redshift to Snowflake. This involved rewriting legacy SQL queries to align with Snowflake’s architecture — including CTEs, result caching, and time-travel features — and scheduling loads using parameterized scripts. I worked closely with data analysts to validate the output and ensure that business logic remained consistent during the transition.
            
            I also implemented event-driven ingestion using AWS Lambda and Step Functions to automatically trigger data pulls when upstream files landed in S3. These flows were orchestrated using AWS CloudWatch Events and included state tracking, error notifications, and retry logic. For operational transparency, I developed dashboards in Amazon QuickSight that visualized pipeline performance metrics, including job run times, error counts, and throughput.
            
            As part of internal platform improvements, I created reusable PySpark templates and parameterized Glue jobs so that new pipelines could be onboarded with minimal effort. I integrated these with AWS Secrets Manager to securely handle credential rotation and with Amazon SNS for push notifications during job failures. Additionally, I wrote Terraform configurations to provision Glue jobs, IAM roles, and CloudWatch log groups, allowing infrastructure to be version-controlled and reproducible across environments.
            
            I collaborated daily with data architects, QA testers, and product owners to ensure that pipelines aligned with evolving data models and SLAs. I participated in code reviews, sprint planning, and design discussions, especially where changes to schema or load strategy affected dependent reporting layers.
            
            This role gave me hands-on experience building production-grade data pipelines on AWS, designing for reliability and cost-efficiency, and bridging engineering efforts with business-driven data needs.
            
            
        <h3>Cognizant Internship (Feb 2022 - Nov 2022)</h3>
        <p>As a Data Engineering Intern at Cognizant, I worked on automating data ingestion and transformation workflows for enterprise reporting systems. My focus was on improving how operational data moved across storage, processing, and analytics layers, particularly using Python and AWS services.

            I started by analyzing existing manual processes where analysts were running SQL queries and copy-pasting CSV data for weekly reports. I automated these workflows using Python scripts scheduled through cron jobs, replacing manual exports with dynamic queries that pulled data from PostgreSQL and pushed results to S3 in parquet format. This not only eliminated repetitive work but also standardized data structure and reduced load times for downstream dashboards.
            
            To expand this system, I integrated AWS Glue to handle larger and more complex datasets, particularly logs in JSON format. I wrote Glue jobs in PySpark to flatten nested data, apply transformation rules, and join across multiple tables before writing to Redshift. I implemented schema validation logic using AWS Glue’s Data Catalog, which allowed the pipeline to detect schema mismatches before runtime and raise notifications via SNS.
            
            Midway through the internship, I contributed to a proof-of-concept project where we used Amazon Athena to analyze audit logs in near real time. I wrote DDL scripts to define external tables over partitioned S3 data, and designed a system that auto-refreshed partitions using Lambda triggers tied to S3 PUT events. This allowed stakeholders to query logs within minutes of arrival, improving visibility for compliance teams.
            
            I also focused on reliability. I added logging wrappers to all ETL scripts and used AWS CloudWatch to track execution status, memory usage, and job durations. I implemented alerting for failure conditions, like missing input files or incomplete loads, and set up detailed job run reports emailed to the data engineering team daily.
            
            This internship helped me understand real-world data engineering constraints — such as working with evolving schemas, optimizing query performance, and ensuring that every pipeline has traceability and error resilience. It also gave me the foundational experience I later built on in my full-time role.

        <h3>Experiential Spring Break (Mar 2025)</h3>
        <p>In March 2025, I was a group leader for Experiential Spring Break at Northeastern University, a week-long program that mixed tech learning with professional growth. On the first day, I visited OneSixOne Ventures to learn about venture capital, getting a sense of investment strategies and what it takes to break into that field. The next day, I took a private course at AWS Skills Center on Demystifying Generative AI, where I explored the differences between AI and ML and how they’re used in the real world. On day three, I toured T-Mobile’s HQ, joining a panel discussion and networking session that showed me how data drives telecom innovation. The fourth day was a visit to Microsoft’s campus, hosted by an NU-Seattle alumna, where I learned about their AI work and got to check out the Xbox room. The week wrapped up with a Prompt Engineering session, which helped me get better at crafting AI interactions. I also made some great connections while exploring Seattle spots like the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and Bellevue Downtown Park, blending tech insights with fun cultural experiences.</p>
        <h3>WoofAid (Dec 2020 - Dec 2022)</h3>
        <p>In December 2020, I co-founded WoofAid with a few friends to help stray dogs and cats in Hyderabad during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many people wrongly believed these animals were spreading the virus. We organized food drives and set up temporary shelters, managing to care for over 200 animals in our first year. I took the lead on coordinating a team of 10 volunteers, handling logistics, managing donations, and spreading the word through social media campaigns that reached over 5,000 people. After 18 months, we got the local government on board, and six months later, we handed over the operations to them so I could focus on starting my career. Our work got some attention at Osmania University, and I was invited for a radio interview by a student club, which was a great chance to share our story. Leading WoofAid taught me how to manage projects, work with a team, and speak confidently about something I cared about. [Placeholder for pictures and video]</p>

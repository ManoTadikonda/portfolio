                        <p>At my first hackathon at Northeastern, I worked on a Legal Document Analyzer, a tool to extract key details from legal texts using natural language processing. I used SpaCy for named entity recognition to pull out things like dates, names, and clauses, and integrated a BERT model to classify documents—like contracts or wills—with 92% accuracy. I built the backend with FastAPI to process the data quickly and created a React frontend to show the results in a clean, easy-to-read table. My team took 2nd place, which was a proud moment and showed I could deliver solid solutions under tight deadlines. My second project was the AI Stylist app, an AI-powered outfit recommendation system. I set up a client-server setup with a React.js frontend using Vite for a fast, smooth UI, and a FastAPI backend to handle the heavy lifting. Using OpenAI’s CLIP model, I made the system analyze clothing details—like type, color, and material—from user-uploaded images. I added real-time weather data through APIs to make weather-appropriate suggestions and let users pick their style preferences, like casual or formal, so the AI could recommend outfits that fit their vibe. The system’s design is modular, supporting different AI models like Hugging Face and Ollama, which makes it easy to scale up in the future.</p>

                        <p>In March 2025, I was a group leader for Experiential Spring Break at Northeastern University, a week-long program that mixed tech learning with professional growth. On the first day, I visited OneSixOne Ventures to learn about venture capital, getting a sense of investment strategies and what it takes to break into that field. The next day, I took a private course at AWS Skills Center on Demystifying Generative AI, where I explored the differences between AI and ML and how they’re used in the real world. On day three, I toured T-Mobile’s HQ, joining a panel discussion and networking session that showed me how data drives telecom innovation. The fourth day was a visit to Microsoft’s campus, hosted by an NU-Seattle alumna, where I learned about their AI work and got to check out the Xbox room. The week wrapped up with a Prompt Engineering session, which helped me get better at crafting AI interactions. I also made some great connections while exploring Seattle spots like the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and Bellevue Downtown Park, blending tech insights with fun cultural experiences.</p>

                        <p>In December 2022, I joined Cognizant full-time as an AWS Data Engineer, working on a historical data migration project for Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which was a huge learning experience. My role involved building and managing data pipelines to migrate over 50 terabytes of sensitive health and personal data, using AWS Glue for ETL processes to extract, transform, and load the data efficiently. I stored the data securely in Amazon S3, set up Amazon Redshift for data warehousing to support analytics, and used AWS Lake Formation to manage data access and governance across the project. Since the data was highly sensitive, I implemented encryption with AWS KMS and set up fine-grained access controls using IAM roles to meet strict healthcare compliance standards. Our team followed agile practices, using Jira to track tasks and holding sprint planning sessions every two weeks to prioritize deliverables and address blockers. I also leveraged AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows, ensuring the pipelines ran smoothly, and used Amazon CloudWatch to monitor job performance, setting up alarms for any failures. By optimizing the Glue jobs with parallel processing and refining Redshift schemas, I helped reduce migration time by 15%. Working with a seasoned team, I deepened my understanding of big data technologies, cloud architecture, and secure data management, learning how to handle large-scale projects with precision and care.</p>

                        <p>I started my internship at Cognizant in February 2022 while finishing up my final year at Osmania University, and it was my first real taste of working in tech. I joined a team migrating an on-premises inventory management app to Azure, where I worked with Azure App Services to deploy the application and Azure Blob Storage to handle product images and transaction logs. One of my tasks was building a monitoring tool with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, setting up alerts for when CPU or memory usage got too high so we could keep the system stable. On weekends, we had assessments where I created a cost optimization dashboard using Azure Cost Management APIs, which helped the team spot underused resources and cut costs by 10%. I was thrilled to be named one of the Top 10 GenZ Interns, which gave me the chance to present my work to senior leaders. The internship really sharpened my skills in cloud computing, Azure tools, and solving problems under pressure.</p>

                        <p>I graduated with a Bachelors in Information Technology from Osmania University in Hyderabad back in June 2022, and it was such a formative experience for me. My courses—like Algorithms, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Distributed Systems, Computer Networks, and Database Systems—gave me a solid grounding in the tech world. I got hands-on with programming in C, C++, Java, and Python, which I used in projects like building a campus navigation system with Dijkstra’s algorithm in C++ to find the shortest paths between buildings. I also created a library management system with a relational database in SQL, figuring out how to structure tables and queries to keep everything running smoothly. Working on a group project where we built a file-sharing app using socket programming in Java taught me how to collaborate effectively, divvy up tasks, and explain technical ideas to my teammates and professors, which really boosted my teamwork and communication skills.</p>

                        <p>During my time at Osmania University, I worked on an Age and Gender Analysis project using Machine Learning, which really got me excited about data science. I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Python and TensorFlow to predict someone’s age and gender from facial images, training it on the UTKFace dataset with 20,000 images. I had to preprocess the data carefully—resizing images, normalizing them, and using data augmentation to handle things like poor lighting or uneven age groups in the dataset. After tweaking the model’s learning rate and batch size, I got it to an accuracy of 87%, which felt like a big win. I presented the project at our university’s tech fest, and the faculty appreciated how it could be used for demographic analysis in real-world scenarios. This project helped me get better at building ML models, cleaning up data, and talking about my work in a clear, technical way.</p>

                        <p>In December 2020, I co-founded WoofAid with a few friends to help stray dogs and cats in Hyderabad during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many people wrongly believed these animals were spreading the virus. We organized food drives and set up temporary shelters, managing to care for over 200 animals in our first year. I took the lead on coordinating a team of 10 volunteers, handling logistics, managing donations, and spreading the word through social media campaigns that reached over 5,000 people. After 18 months, we got the local government on board, and six months later, we handed over the operations to them so I could focus on starting my career. Our work got some attention at Osmania University, and I was invited for a radio interview by a student club, which was a great chance to share our story. Leading WoofAid taught me how to manage projects, work with a team, and speak confidently about something I cared about. [Placeholder for pictures and video]</p>

        <h3>Hackathon Projects</h3>
        <p>At my first hackathon at Northeastern, I worked on a Legal Document Analyzer, a tool to extract key details from legal texts using natural language processing. I used SpaCy for named entity recognition to pull out things like dates, names, and clauses, and integrated a BERT model to classify documents—like contracts or wills—with 92% accuracy. I built the backend with FastAPI to process the data quickly and created a React frontend to show the results in a clean, easy-to-read table. My team took 2nd place, which was a proud moment and showed I could deliver solid solutions under tight deadlines. My second project was the AI Stylist app, an AI-powered outfit recommendation system. I set up a client-server setup with a React.js frontend using Vite for a fast, smooth UI, and a FastAPI backend to handle the heavy lifting. Using OpenAI’s CLIP model, I made the system analyze clothing details—like type, color, and material—from user-uploaded images. I added real-time weather data through APIs to make weather-appropriate suggestions and let users pick their style preferences, like casual or formal, so the AI could recommend outfits that fit their vibe. The system’s design is modular, supporting different AI models like Hugging Face and Ollama, which makes it easy to scale up in the future.</p>
        <h3>University Project - Age and Gender Analysis Using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>During my time at Osmania University, I worked on an Age and Gender Analysis project using Machine Learning, which really got me excited about data science. I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Python and TensorFlow to predict someone’s age and gender from facial images, training it on the UTKFace dataset with 20,000 images. I had to preprocess the data carefully—resizing images, normalizing them, and using data augmentation to handle things like poor lighting or uneven age groups in the dataset. After tweaking the model’s learning rate and batch size, I got it to an accuracy of 87%, which felt like a big win. I presented the project at our university’s tech fest, and the faculty appreciated how it could be used for demographic analysis in real-world scenarios. This project helped me get better at building ML models, cleaning up data, and talking about my work in a clear, technical way.</p>

        <h3>Cognizant Full-Time - AWS Data Engineer (Dec 2022 - Dec 2023)</h3>
        <p>In December 2022, I joined Cognizant full-time as an AWS Data Engineer, working on a historical data migration project for Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which was a huge learning experience. My role involved building and managing data pipelines to migrate over 50 terabytes of sensitive health and personal data, using AWS Glue for ETL processes to extract, transform, and load the data efficiently. I stored the data securely in Amazon S3, set up Amazon Redshift for data warehousing to support analytics, and used AWS Lake Formation to manage data access and governance across the project. Since the data was highly sensitive, I implemented encryption with AWS KMS and set up fine-grained access controls using IAM roles to meet strict healthcare compliance standards. Our team followed agile practices, using Jira to track tasks and holding sprint planning sessions every two weeks to prioritize deliverables and address blockers. I also leveraged AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows, ensuring the pipelines ran smoothly, and used Amazon CloudWatch to monitor job performance, setting up alarms for any failures. By optimizing the Glue jobs with parallel processing and refining Redshift schemas, I helped reduce migration time by 15%. Working with a seasoned team, I deepened my understanding of big data technologies, cloud architecture, and secure data management, learning how to handle large-scale projects with precision and care.</p>
        <h3>Cognizant Internship - Azure Project (Feb 2022 - Nov 2022)</h3>
        <p>I started my internship at Cognizant in February 2022 while finishing up my final year at Osmania University, and it was my first real taste of working in tech. I joined a team migrating an on-premises inventory management app to Azure, where I worked with Azure App Services to deploy the application and Azure Blob Storage to handle product images and transaction logs. One of my tasks was building a monitoring tool with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, setting up alerts for when CPU or memory usage got too high so we could keep the system stable. On weekends, we had assessments where I created a cost optimization dashboard using Azure Cost Management APIs, which helped the team spot underused resources and cut costs by 10%. I was thrilled to be named one of the Top 10 GenZ Interns, which gave me the chance to present my work to senior leaders. The internship really sharpened my skills in cloud computing, Azure tools, and solving problems under pressure.</p>

        <h3>Experiential Spring Break (Mar 2025)</h3>
        <p>In March 2025, I was a group leader for Experiential Spring Break at Northeastern University, a week-long program that mixed tech learning with professional growth. On the first day, I visited OneSixOne Ventures to learn about venture capital, getting a sense of investment strategies and what it takes to break into that field. The next day, I took a private course at AWS Skills Center on Demystifying Generative AI, where I explored the differences between AI and ML and how they’re used in the real world. On day three, I toured T-Mobile’s HQ, joining a panel discussion and networking session that showed me how data drives telecom innovation. The fourth day was a visit to Microsoft’s campus, hosted by an NU-Seattle alumna, where I learned about their AI work and got to check out the Xbox room. The week wrapped up with a Prompt Engineering session, which helped me get better at crafting AI interactions. I also made some great connections while exploring Seattle spots like the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and Bellevue Downtown Park, blending tech insights with fun cultural experiences.</p>
        <h3>WoofAid (Dec 2020 - Dec 2022)</h3>
        <p>In December 2020, I co-founded WoofAid with a few friends to help stray dogs and cats in Hyderabad during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many people wrongly believed these animals were spreading the virus. We organized food drives and set up temporary shelters, managing to care for over 200 animals in our first year. I took the lead on coordinating a team of 10 volunteers, handling logistics, managing donations, and spreading the word through social media campaigns that reached over 5,000 people. After 18 months, we got the local government on board, and six months later, we handed over the operations to them so I could focus on starting my career. Our work got some attention at Osmania University, and I was invited for a radio interview by a student club, which was a great chance to share our story. Leading WoofAid taught me how to manage projects, work with a team, and speak confidently about something I cared about. [Placeholder for pictures and video]</p>
